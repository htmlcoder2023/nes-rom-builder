# nes-rom-builder

This is a Python program that attempts to build matching game ROMs by brute-forcing every possible ROM combination for mapper 0. There is also a .txt file that can pasted into cmd that provides information about the game's hashes. If you are willing to add a .txt file that contains a game's hashes for this project, open a pull request.
